# Wrangle and Analyze Data


WeRateDogs project is a part of *Data Analyst Nanodegree* program. This dataset is provided by Twitter account @dog_rates, I will perform wrangling process using Python language then deliver notable insights by descriptive statistics and visualizstion.

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision making in less time. The wrangling process is divided into four main sections:
* Gathering
* Assessing
* Cleaning
* Storing/ Visualizing
 
### Why this project
Learning to know how to prepare and organize data for analysis is essential in today ever-growing use of big data. This process typically includes many manually converting/mapping data from one raw form to another format to allow for more convenient consumption. The goal of data wrangling is to reveal a "deeper intelligence" within data, provide accurate, actionable data for analysts, reduce the time spent before it can be utilized, and drive better decisions in the organization.
